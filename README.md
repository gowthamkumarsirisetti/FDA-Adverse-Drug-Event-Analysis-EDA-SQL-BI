# 🧪 FDA Adverse Drug Event Analysis (Python + SQL + Power BI)

## 📊 Project Summary

This is a complete real-world **healthcare analytics project** using publicly available **FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)** data.

Using **Python**, **MySQL**, and **Power BI**, this project extracts, transforms, and visualizes drug safety data to uncover hidden insights about adverse drug reactions, gender risks, and fatality trends in patients.
